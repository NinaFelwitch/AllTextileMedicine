	While playing, it bothered me that medicine can only be crafted with vanilla coth and no other fabrics.
	So I looked into making mods for RimWorld and this is the result.

	This mod allows crafting medicine with all fabrics and I also added a recipe to craft 5 medicine at a time. 
	And I changed the workSkill from Intellectual to Medicine.
